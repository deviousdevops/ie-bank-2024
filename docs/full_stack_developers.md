## Git Feature Branch Strategy

This section covers the Git feature branch strategy, describing how the team manages feature branches and the configuration applied in GitHub to implement this strategy. Our strategy consits of:

- Protecting the main branch with GitHub branch policies

- Use short-living feature branches for new code development (give each feature branch a name representative of the new code being developed)

- Integrate the code soon via Pull Request to the main branch. Other person in the team needs to review a approve.

- **Git Feature Branch Strategy**: [[Git Feature Branch Strategy URL](https://github.com/deviousdevops/ie-bank-fe-2024/settings/rules/2893529)]

### Branch Protection Strategy

This strategy ensures the integrity, security, and quality of the codebase while facilitating collaboration. Below are the enabled protections and their purposes.

### Enabled Settings

### 1. Restrict Deletions
- **Description**: Only users with bypass permissions can delete the branch.
- **Purpose**: Prevents accidental or unauthorized deletion of critical branches.

### 2. Require Linear History
- **Description**: Disallows merge commits, enforcing a linear Git history.
- **Purpose**: Maintains a clean and readable commit history.

### 3. Require Merge Queue
- **Description**: Merges are processed sequentially through a queue.
- **Purpose**: Prevents conflicting changes and ensures orderly integration.

### 4. Require Signed Commits
- **Description**: All commits must have verified signatures.
- **Purpose**: Verifies the authenticity of commits to enhance security.

### 5. Require a Pull Request Before Merging
- **Description**: All changes must be submitted as pull requests.
- **Purpose**: Ensures every change is reviewed for quality and accuracy.

#### Pull Request Sub-settings:
- **Request Pull Request Review from Copilot**: Automatically requests reviews from Copilot when applicable.

### 6. Allowed Merge Methods
- **Description**: Supports Merge Commit, Squash, and Rebase methods.
- **Purpose**: Provides flexibility for integrating changes effectively.

### 7. Block Force Pushes
- **Description**: Prevents force pushes to the branch.
- **Purpose**: Protects branch history from being overwritten or altered.

---

### Benefits
- **Security**: Verified commits and blocked force pushes protect against unauthorized changes.
- **Code Quality**: Mandatory pull requests ensure peer review.
- **History Clarity**: Linear history and merge flexibility maintain a clean commit log.

This strategy safeguards the codebase while supporting team productivity and collaboration.

## Continuous Integration (CI) Workflow for Frontend
This section details the CI workflow for the frontend, highlighting the build steps that ensure the frontend code is continuously tested and integrated.

- **CI Workflow for Frontend**: [[CI Workflow for Frontend URL](https://github.com/deviousdevops/ie-bank-fe-2024/blob/main/.github/workflows/ie-bank-frontend.yml)]
  
### Trigger Events
- push to any branch deploys dev
- pull_request to the main branch deploys dev, uat and prod
- workflow_dispatch (manual trigger)
  
### Environment Variables
- KeyVault_DEV: Name of Azure Key Vault for Development
- KeyVault_UAT: Name of the Azure Key Vault for UAT
- KeyVault_PROD: Name of the Azure Key Vault for Production

### Build Job
Each environment has a separate build job that:
- *Runs on*: ubuntu-latest
- *Steps*:
  1. **Checks out the code**: Retrieves the latest code from the repository to ensure the workflow operates on the most up-to-date version of the application.
  2. **Sets up the required Node.js environment**: Configures the Node.js runtime environment to match the application's requirements, including version and caching for dependencies.
  3. **Installs dependencies and builds the application using environment-specific .env files**: Downloads all required libraries and packages, and compiles the frontend application with environment-specific configurations (e.g., Development, UAT, or Production).
  4. **Uploads the build artifacts for use in the corresponding deployment job**: Saves the compiled application files (e.g., dist-dev, dist-uat, dist-prod) as artifacts to be used in the subsequent deployment step for each environment.

## Test/Behavior Driven Development Strategy

The Test/Behavior Driven Development (TDD/BDD) strategy defines how the team designs tests and selects User Stories to drive development through testing. This section of the document provides an overview of the unit and functional tests for the IE Bank backend project. The tests are written using pytest and cover various aspects of the application's models, including user creation, account creation, and transactions.

## Release Strategy

The release strategy outlines the process, tools, and techniques used to release updates for both the frontend and backend of IE Bank.

- **Release Strategy**: [[Release Strategy URL](https://deviousdevops.github.io/ie-bank-2024/cloud_architect.html#release-strategy)]

### Inner Loop

The inner loop refers to the development cycle where developers make changes to the codebase, run tests locally, and ensure that their changes work as expected before committing the code. This loop is focused on rapid feedback and iteration to improve code quality and functionality.

1. *Code Changes*: Developers make changes to the codebase.
2. *Local Testing*: Developers run tests locally to verify their changes.
3. *Commit and Push*: Once satisfied, developers commit their changes and push them to the remote repository.

### Outer Loop
The outer loop refers to the CI/CD pipeline that takes over once the code is pushed to the remote repository. This loop ensures that the code is built, tested, and deployed in an automated and consistent manner across different environments.

1. *Trigger Events*: The workflow is triggered by push events, pull requests to the main branch, or manual dispatches.
2. *Build Job*: The code is checked out, dependencies are installed, and the code is linted and tested.
3. *Artifact Upload*: The build artifacts are uploaded for use in deployment jobs.
4. *Deploy to Development*: The build artifacts are downloaded, and the application is deployed to the Development environment.
5. *Deploy to UAT*: The build artifacts are downloaded, and the application is deployed to the UAT environment.
6. *Run Postman Tests*: Postman tests are run on the UAT environment to verify the deployment.
7. *Deploy to Production*: The build artifacts are downloaded, and the application is deployed to the Production environment.

### Outer Loop
The outer loop automates the CI/CD pipeline for building, testing, and deploying the frontend to Azure Static Web Apps across environments.

1. **Trigger Events**: Triggered by push, pull requests to main, or manual dispatch (workflow_dispatch).
2. **Build Jobs**:
   - Check out code, set up Node.js, install dependencies, build with .env files, and upload artifacts (dist-dev, dist-uat, dist-prod).
3. **Deploy to Development**:
   - Download artifact (node-app-dev), fetch deployment token from Development Key Vault, and deploy to Azure Static Web App.
4. **Deploy to UAT**:
   - After build-uat and deploy-dev, download artifact (node-app-uat), fetch UAT token, and deploy.
5. **Deploy to Production**:
   - After build-prod and deploy-uat, download artifact (node-app-prod), fetch Production token, and deploy.
6. **Output URLs**: Log Static Web App URLs for each environment.
