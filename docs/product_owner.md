![Product Vision Board](images/product_vision_board.png)

- **Vision**:
  IE Bank by Devious Devops envisions secure, intuitive online banking where customers confidently manage their finances, securely and comfortably. Over the next decade, we aim to set the standard for transparent, ethical, and user-first banking by reducing complexity, empowering users, and delivering lasting value. Our shared ambition inspires and unites our team to create positive change, handle data responsibly, and ensure no harm to people or the planet, guiding us toward a future of sustainable innovation.

- **Target Group**:
  Our core target group consists of tech-savvy adults aged 25–45 who regularly use online financial services. They prefer digital self-service experiences, value robust security, and seek simplicity in their day-to-day banking. This group’s members share common behavioral traits: frequent online transactions, and a strong desire to reduce time spent managing finances.

- **Needs**:
  These customers primarily want a banking experience that saves time and reduces frustration. They need a secure way to log in, quickly review account balances, understand transaction histories, and complete transfers with minimal effort. Their definition of success is measured by the ease and reliability of these tasks. We specify and focus on the main benefit: making account management and transfers quick, worry-free, and transparent.

- **Product**:
  IE Bank’s product is a straightforward, browser-based web application that serves as a digital gateway to account management. It differentiates itself through a user experience that places clarity and security above all else. By offering a clean set of capabilities—user registration with automatic account creation, a secure login process, an intuitive account dashboard, reliable money transfers, and an admin portal for managing users—the product avoids overwhelming complexity. These big-picture features stand as core pillars that set us apart from alternatives, ensuring our product remains focused on delivering value, not feature bloat.

- **Business Goals**:
  We aim to reduce manual customer support by 20% in the first year, boosting overall customer satisfaction to consistently above 4/5, and cutting operational overhead through the admin portal, compared to our first iteration. Our goals remain measurable, specific, prioritized, and connected to tangible business impact. 

- **Competitors**:
  Our main competitors are established digital banking platforms known for their broad feature sets and brand recognition. While they excel at offering extensive product lines and trusted security measures, they often struggle with overly complex user interfaces and slower adaptation to emerging user needs. We differentiate ourselves by maintaining a narrow focus on simplicity, ensuring our product stands out through streamlined experiences, faster iteration, and a user-first design philosophy.

- **Revenue Streams**:
  We plan to monetize by providing premium banking services, such as low-cost international transfers, higher interest savings accounts, and tiered subscription models for advanced capabilities. By aligning our revenue strategy with the value provided to users, we ensure that our income generation is tied to improved customer satisfaction and the consistent delivery of meaningful features.

- **Cost Factors**:
  Key cost factors include technology infrastructure, cloud hosting, transactional fees, compliance and security certifications, and customer support resources. We regularly assess and optimize these expenses to maintain a lean operation, maximizing cost efficiency without sacrificing quality, reliability, or security.

- **Channels**:
  We will market and sell the product primarily through digital channels, leveraging search engine marketing, social media ads, content marketing, and partnerships with reputable financial bloggers and fintech comparison sites. These existing channels enable us to reach the target audience effectively, while ongoing search engine optimization and user referrals ensure sustained growth.
